#
# Before you begin, please note the following:
#
# 1. All Monitors must have a unique Id
# 2. All Modes under a Monitor must have a unique width/height
# 3. All refresh rates under a Mode must be unique
#
# Every class, attribute, and function is annotated with a __doc__, which also shows the type's
# type signature.
#
# Final note: It is possible to have stale data in memory, and this can cause duplicate Ids.
#             However, if it is sent to the driver, the driver will simply ignore the duplicates.
#             When notify() is done, it DOES NOT check the latest data! You must reconcile differences via
#             either get_state(), or set up a receiver() to be notified of new changes
#
